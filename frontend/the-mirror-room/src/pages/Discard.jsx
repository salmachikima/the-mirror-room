        This is the beginning of the end, here you will think u lost your self after all the love bombing.
         they will throw your broken self away after breaking you and taking what they wanted from you. While in some cases the narcissists
          never let go of their victims, they keep them under control, they depersonalize them and make them totally dependent on them
          and if there's any sign of rebellion coming out of the victim they will plot for revenge
        .Narcissists usually make sure to trap u in an unfinite loop of agony to break you completely and suffocate you alive
        until there's no sign of rebellion.
