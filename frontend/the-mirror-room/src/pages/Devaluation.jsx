        They started to pick at your softness. Little remarks. Cold silences.
        You were no longer adored. You were slowly dismantled.here where they drop the mask
        and start showing their real face "technically speaking". they will turn their once beautiful words into insults, 
        all this to try to make you more vulnerable and more easy to break, aka they wanna depersonalize you.
