        The healing part while u will start regaining your conciousness and get to know the toxic loop clearer. 

        you will start reflecting on your self, seeing the patterns, 
        and maybe realize it's time to move on for good. Being a victim of a narcissist is not easy as it sounds, 
        it will need a long deep healing after it.
